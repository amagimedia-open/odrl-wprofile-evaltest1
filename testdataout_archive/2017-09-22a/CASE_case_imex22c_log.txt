 DESCRIPTION: Permission with duty having action refinement and constraint
 MSG: JSON-LD read, parsed, transformed to RDF, files written 
 NEXT STEP: Start evaluation of Rule with id '_:b14_b0'
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all constraints of the Rule, status = Not-Existing
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all refinements of 'http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/play', status = Not-Existing
 NEXT STEP: Evaluation of Duty instance '_:b14_b1', referenced by 'http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/duty'
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of Constraint instance '_:b14_b4' (a http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/constraint), status = Satisfied (preset)
 NEXT STEP: Evaluation of ActionExercised of action (of '_:b14_b1')
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of Constraint instance '_:b14_b3' (a http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/refinement), status = Not-Satisfied (preset)
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all refinements of '_:b14_b2', status = Not-Satisfied
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of ActionExercised '_:b14_b2' - refinments, status = Not-Existing (action not existing by Not-Satisfied refinement)
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of Duty instance '_:b14_b1', status = ERROR (action not existing)
 TESTRESULT-FINAL: Evaluation of the full Permission instance, status = ERROR
