 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all refinements of '_:b21_b2', status = Not-Satisfied
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of ActionExercised '_:b21_b2' - refinements, status = Not-Existing (action not existing by Not-Satisfied refinement)
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of Duty instance '_:b21_b1', status = Not-Fulfilled (action not existing = not exercised)
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all consequence-Duty instances of  '_:b21_b0' - consequence '_:b21_b1' returned Not-Fulfilled
