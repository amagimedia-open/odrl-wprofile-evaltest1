 DESCRIPTION: Permission with target refinement
 MSG: JSON-LD read, parsed, transformed to RDF, files written 
 NEXT STEP: Start evaluation of Rule with id '_:b10_b0'
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all constraints of the Rule, status = Not-Existing
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of Constraint instance '_:b10_b2' (a http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/refinement), status = Not-Satisfied (preset)
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all refinements of '_:b10_b1', status = Not-Satisfied
