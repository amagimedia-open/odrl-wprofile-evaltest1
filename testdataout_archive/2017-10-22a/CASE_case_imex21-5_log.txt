 MSG: JSON-LD read, parsed, transformed to RDF, files written 
 NEXT STEP: Start evaluation of Rule with id '_:b23_b0'
 NEXT STEP: Evaluation of Duty instance '_:b23_b0', referenced by 'http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/obligation'
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all refinements of 'http://example.com/document:XZY', status = Not-Existing
 NOTICE: Duty has no assignee
 NEXT STEP: Evaluation of ActionExercised of action (of Rule '_:b23_b0')
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all refinements of 'http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/delete', status = Not-Existing
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of ActionExercised 'http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/delete' (action of '_:b23_b0'), status = Exercised (preset)

 NEXT STEP: Evaluation of ActionExercised of action (of Rule '_:b23_b1')
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of Constraint instance '_:b23_b3' (a http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/refinement), status = Not-Satisfied (preset)
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all refinements of '_:b23_b2', status = Not-Satisfied
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of ActionExercised '_:b23_b2' - refinements, status = Not-Existing (action not existing by Not-Satisfied refinement)
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of Duty instance '_:b23_b1', status = Not-Fulfilled (action not existing = not exercised)
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all consequence-Duty instances of  '_:b23_b0' - consequence '_:b23_b1' returned Not-Fulfilled
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of Duty instance '_:b23_b0', status = Not-Fulfilled (action not exercised, consequences Not-Fulfilled)
