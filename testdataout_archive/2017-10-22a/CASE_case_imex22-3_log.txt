 DESCRIPTION: Permission with duty having action refinement and constraint
 MSG: JSON-LD read, parsed, transformed to RDF, files written 
 NEXT STEP: Start evaluation of Rule with id '_:b26_b0'
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all constraints of the Rule, status = Not-Existing
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all refinements of 'http://example.com/music/1999.mp3', status = Not-Existing
 NOTICE: Permission has no assignee
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all refinements of 'http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/play', status = Not-Existing

 NOTICE: Duty has no target
 NOTICE: Duty has no assignee
 NEXT STEP: Evaluation of ActionExercised of action (of Rule '_:b26_b1')
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of Constraint instance '_:b26_b3' (a http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/refinement), status = Not-Satisfied (preset)
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of all refinements of '_:b26_b2', status = Not-Satisfied
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of ActionExercised '_:b26_b2' - refinements, status = Not-Existing (action not existing by Not-Satisfied refinement)
 TESTRESULT: Evaluation of Duty instance '_:b26_b1', status = Not-Fulfilled (action not existing = not exercised)
 TESTRESULT-FINAL: Evaluation of the full Permission instance [Eval: ACTIVE], status = Not-Allowed
